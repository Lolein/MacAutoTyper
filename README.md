# MacAutoTyper
This is a simple code to make a functional auto typer for Mac using AppleScript.

Works in all Mac OS.

To make the code run properly, you need to authorize your code editor program in case you haven't done it yet (you can even use the built-in Script Editor on your Mac device) by going to "Security and privacy" in settings, click "Privacy" and then "Accessibility", look for your code editor and authorize it to control your Mac.

In your code editor, just modify the values in the "main.applescript" file as you want, run it and you are done, enjoy!
